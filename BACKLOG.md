## Scheduling Guidelines

When planning a new phase, review this backlog:

1. **Check P1 items** - Should any be scheduled for the next phase?
2. **Look for synergies** - Do any backlog items align with planned work?
3. **Update target phases** - Move items from Backlog to specific phases as appropriate
4. **Clean up** - Remove completed items, update priorities as project evolves
