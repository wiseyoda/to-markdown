## How to Use This Document

### For Future Phases
When starting a new phase that inherits deferred items:
1. Check the "Target Phase" column in the summary table
2. Reference this file in the new phase's spec.md
3. Copy applicable items into the new spec's scope

### For ROADMAP.md Updates
The roadmap phase entry should include:
```markdown
**Deferred from Previous Phases** (see `specs/[PREV_PHASE]/checklists/deferred.md`):
- [Item 1 brief description]
- [Item 2 brief description]
```

### For Backlog Items
Items marked "Backlog" should also be added to the project-level `BACKLOG.md` file.
