## Review Constraints Applied

- Full codebase review (no incremental mode)
- Does NOT propose brand new features
- Does NOT break existing functionality without confirmation
- Focus on refinement and technical debt reduction

## Category Definitions

| Code | Category | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| BP | Best Practices | Coding standards violations, anti-patterns, inconsistencies |
| RF | Refactoring | Code duplication, complex functions, poor structure |
| HD | Hardening | Error handling gaps, input validation, security issues |
| MF | Missing Features | TODOs, FIXMEs, stub functions, incomplete implementations |
| OC | Orphaned Code | Unused exports, dead code, unreferenced files |
| OE | Over-Engineering | Excessive abstraction, unused flexibility, premature optimization |
| OD | Outdated Docs | Stale comments, README mismatches, incorrect examples |

- **Phase Directory**: `.specify/phases/[PHASE_DIR]/`
- **ROADMAP.md**: Phase entry added
- **Backlog**: Deferred items added with review date reference

## How to Use This Document

### For Implementation
1. Run `/flow.orchestrate` to build spec/plan/tasks from approved findings
2. Each approved finding becomes a requirement in the spec
3. Related findings are grouped into implementation tasks

### For Future Reviews
1. Check deferred items before next review
2. Items may have been resolved or become more urgent
3. Reference this document in subsequent reviews

### For Backlog Management
1. Deferred items are added to ROADMAP.md backlog
2. Run `/flow.roadmap` to triage deferred items into phases
3. Items include the review date for tracking
